Thanks for sharing your resume and current README. Your README is already clean and professional, but I can suggest some **tweaks** and **enhancements** based on your resume to make it more aligned and impactful:

---

### ✅ **Changes/Improvements Based on Your Resume**

1. **Add your current CGPA (since it's strong – 9.0).**
2. **Update Skills** to include what’s in the resume: SQL, Figma, Postman, and Version Control tools (Git/GitHub).
3. **Add your personal portfolio link.**
4. **Include certifications**: Vehicle Detection (ML) and Clean & Green Technology Project.
5. **Mention soft skills** like "Critical Thinking, Adaptability" etc. (only the most relevant ones).
6. **Standardize Tech Stack categories** (Frontend, Backend, Tools, etc.).
